She earned her name from the red hooded cloak her dear grandmother had lovingly made for her. "Be careful, my dear," her mother warned. "Stay on the path and don\'t talk to strangers." Little Red promised to follow her mother\'s instructions and set off on her journey with a skip in her step.","As Little Red hummed a merry tune while walking along the path, a cunning wolf had been watching her from the shadows. "Good morning, Little Red Riding Hood," the wolf said, pretending to be friendly. "Where are you off to with such a lovely basket?" "I\'m going to visit my grandmother. She\'s not feeling well, and I\'m taking her some goodies to make her feel better," replied Little Red. The wolf, plotting to get the treats, suggested she pick some flowers from the meadow for her grandmother. Little Red agreed and wandered into the meadow, while the wolf ran ahead to her grandmother\'s cottage.","The wolf reached the grandmother\'s cottage, locked her in the closet, and disguised himself by putting on her nightcap and glasses. When Little Red arrived, she knocked on the door. "Grandma, it\'s me, Little Red Riding Hood. I\'ve brought you some treats." The wolf, in a disguised voice, replied, "Come in, my dear." As she entered, Little Red noticed something odd. "Grandma, what big eyes you have," she said. The wolf responded, "The better to see you with, my dear." She grew more suspicious, noticing the big ears and teeth.","Just as the wolf revealed himself and was about to pounce, a brave woodsman burst into the cottage. Hearing the commotion, he had come to rescue Little Red and her grandmother. With a mighty swing of his axe, the woodsman frightened the wolf away. Little Red and her grandmother were safe. From that day on, Little Red learned an important lesson about staying on the path and not talking to strangers. She thanked the woodsman for saving her and promised to be more careful in the future."],"illustrations":["A close-up of a brown-haired girl wearing a red cloak, standing in a shadowy forest. Her wide eyes show a worried expression as she grips the edge of her cloak. In the background, faintly visible among the trees, the silhouette of a lurking wolf blends into the darkness.

A cunning 5-year-old male wolf with sleek gray fur and sharp yellow eyes lurks behind a tree, watching her. Tall, lush green trees surround the path. ","Outside a small cozy cottage, a 7-year-old girl with curly brown hair is knocking on the door, looking curious. Through the window, a 60-year-old woman with gray hair in a nightcap and glasses peeks out, appearing gentle and frail. The charming cottage has flower boxes under the windows. ","Inside a cottage, a brave 35-year-old man with short brown hair bursts through the door holding an axe, looking determined.
